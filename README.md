# Classification on MNIST dataset, without using convolution

Objective: To obtain XXXX XXX XXXXXXXX results on MNIST dataset, without using convolution.

This is the first official project of my portfolio. 

## What is MNIST
MNIST is a well-known dataset, containing images of numbers ranging from zero to nine, for multilabel classification. 
It contains 60,000 training and 10,000 validation images of size 28x28.

## My current projects 
1. Two Layers Neural Network and Universal Approximation Theorem </br>
First, we explain the Universal Approximation Theorem and illustrate the application of this property.
Then, we show how we could obtain the best accuracy based on two layers neural network. </br>
[Accuracy : ]
