# Classification on MNIST dataset, without using convolution

Objective: To obtain XXXX XXX XXXXXXXX results on MNIST dataset, without using convolution.

This is the first official project of my portfolio. 

## What is MNIST
MNIST is a well-known dataset, containing images of numbers ranging from zero to nine, for multilabel classification. 
It contains 60,000 training and 10,000 validation images of size 28x28.

## My current projects 
1. [Accuracy: ] Two Layers Neural Network and Universal Approximation Theorem 
First, we explain the Universal Approximation Theorem and illustrate the application of this property.
Then, we show how we could obtain the best accuracy based on two layers neural network.

2. [Accuracy: ] Deep Neural Network and XXX
