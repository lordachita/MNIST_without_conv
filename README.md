# Classification on MNIST dataset, without using convolution

Objective: To obtain XXXX XXX XXXXXXXX results on MNIST dataset, without using convolutions.

## What is MNIST?
MNIST is a well-known dataset, containing images of numbers ranging from zero to nine, for multilabel classification. 
It contains 60,000 training and 10,000 validation images of size 28x28. </br>

## How important is this project, 
## compared to other MNIST classification projects?
The approach of this project will usually start from using existing theorems in Mathematics since the writer has a background in Mathematics. </br>
Then, we show how we implement this concept to acheive the goal of each work.

## My current projects 
### 01. Two Layers Neural Network and Universal Approximation Property </br>
First, we explain the Universal Approximation Property (UP) and illustrate how to implement this property for multilabels classification. </br>
Then, we show the method to obtain the best result, based only on two layers neural network. </br>
[Accuracy : 95.02] </br>

### -01. Convolutional Neural Network 

This is the first official project of my portfolio.
