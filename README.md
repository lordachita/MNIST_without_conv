# Classification on MNIST dataset, without using convolution (?)

Objective: To obtain XXXX XXX XXXXXXXX results on MNIST dataset, without using convolutions.

## What is MNIST?
MNIST is a well-known dataset, containing images of numbers ranging from zero to nine, for multilabel classification. 
It contains 60,000 training and 10,000 validation images of size 28x28. </br>

## How important is this project, compared to other MNIST classification projects?
The approach of this project usually starts from existing mathematical theorems since the writer has a long-time background in Mathematics. 
Then, we illustrate how we implement these concepts in order to acheive the goal of each part.

## My current projects 
### 01. Two Layers Neural Network and Universal Approximation Property </br>
First, we explain the Universal Approximation Property (UAP) and illustrate how we implement this property for multilabels classification. </br>
After that, we show how we use two layers neural network in order to obtain the best possible result. </br>
[Accuracy : 95.02] </br>

### -01. Convolutional Neural Network 

This is the first official project of my portfolio.
