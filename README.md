# Classification on MNIST dataset, without using convolution

Objective: To obtain XXXX XXX XXXXXXXX results on MNIST dataset, without using convolution.

This is the first official project of my portfolio. 

## What is MNIST
MNIST is a well-known dataset, containing images of numbers ranging from zero to nine, for multilabel classification. 
It contains 60,000 training and 10,000 validation images of size 28x28.
